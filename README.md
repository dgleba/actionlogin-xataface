# actionlogin-xataface


This repo is a mimimal example app showing an issue I am trying to resolve in Xataface. See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/xataface/5KXPXV2awVI/discussion



## Post

I want to go to a custom action URL by clicking a link from another app and get a login prompt if not logged in, then be taken to the action URL.

1. I visit http://localhost/actionlogin/index.php?-action=hello
2. I get a blank white screen.
3. Note: If I am logged in I get the proper results.

What I want is to get a login prompt if I am not logged in and then get the action URL results.

A minimal example app is located at: https://github.com/dgleba/actionlogin-xataface


Can someone help me achieve the desired result?

thanks.
